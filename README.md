# Poker-Predictor
A basic poker AI I made during class over the course of a week cuz I got bored

It works but like not very well

It just uses super basic Q-learning and if you were to play around with the weights and inputs it could probably work pretty well 
but honestly once it could actually play I got tired of the project and had some work to do so I stopped


There is like no documentation here at all so sorry about that but again, pointless project I made out of boredom so dont sue me

The variables and functions have pretty streight foward names (I didn't just call it like x3) so it shouldn't be that hard to figure out
